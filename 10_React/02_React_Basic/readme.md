# Notes
## What is React:
## Why React
    - Very fase
    - Easy event handling(shortcut)
    - it is small lib
    - it manage UI by states 
## Component
    - it is a basically isolated, reuseable, independent piece of code just like function 
    - type of component
        - 1. functional component (hooks, state Dynamic)
        - 2. class component (state,render)
## JSX
    - HTML + JS => is called JS
    - A syntax used in React that lets you write HTML inside JavaScript.
    - JSX Rule (What is not Allowed):
            - 1. no function and varibale declaration 
            - 2. No Loop (for , while etc) (Solution: Map & Filter Use)
            - 3. if - else not allowed (Solution: Ternary Operator)
            - 4. no Object render allowed (Solution: Array Render)
## class component (Dynamic):
    1. state: 
        - React obj
        - info/properties of React component
    2. render: 
        - displayed of UI
        - whenever state is changed , render is called
